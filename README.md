![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

It's a simple project to display and control a truma combi D with a [Cheap
Yellow Display](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display).

It's an mqtt client using the topics made available by
[TruMinus](https://github.com/olivluca/TruMinus) and uses the
[esp32-smartdisplay](https://github.com/rzeldent/esp32-smartdisplay)
library.

The UI has been generated with [Squareline studio](https://squareline.io/).
